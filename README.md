# StatusStyler
Developed in Microsoft Code.fun.do. A WebApp that lets user style the statues posted using fonts and colors for individual words in them. This feature has not yet been implemented in any social networking sites.


First you need to select the Color and Font and then enter the text in the box. You can see the preveiw of it just below it. If you want that font and color you can push into the final window on the right. When you click on "POST" the HTML code will be sent to the web servers.
